I coded an interpreter for the PostScript language in Python. PostScript is a stack-based, interpreted language developed by Adobe Systems long ago for producing high-quality text and graphics in the printing industry. My interpreter includes the operators: add, sub, mul, div, mod, eq, lt, gt, length, get, getinterval, put, if, ifelse, for, dup, copy, clear, exch, roll, and dict.
