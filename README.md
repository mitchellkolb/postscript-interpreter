I coded an interpreter for the PostScript language in Python. PostScript is a stack-based, interpreted language developed by Adobe Systems long ago for producing vector graphics in the printing industry. My interpreter includes the operators: add, sub, mul, div, mod, eq, lt, gt, length, get, getinterval, put, if, ifelse, for, dup, copy, clear, exch, roll, and dict.

# What I Learned in this Project
- How to code in python with emphasis using: 
    - Higher Order Functions like map, filter, and reduce
    - Static Scoping and Dynamic Scoping
    - Pythons strong dyanmic typing
    - Data types / systems like iterators, iterables, streams, classes, closures, and objects
- Understanding how Pythons handles its Scope, Referencing Environment, and Activation Record when dealing with programs and data.
- Differences between:
    - Compile-time (static) type checking versus Run-time (dynamic) type checking
    - Storage Management
      - Static area
      - Stack
      - Heap

# How to Set Up
This project was implemented on my local machine inside of a virtual machine using vscode:
- [Ubuntu Download](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)
- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Clone this repository 
- Open terminal at the codebase `~.../postscript-interpreter/sps-part-1/` or `~.../postscript-interpreter/sps-part-2/`
- Run the python file with some arugments in the main function or try out the tests file to see example input/output.
